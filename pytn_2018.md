## Tests, amirite?
* Unit
* Integration
* Regression
* Acceptance

Do we really need to add to this?

Note: We already have a comprehensive suite of tests, why do we need another one?

Let's look at the most common test, the unit test, and see why we want to do more
---
## Unit Tests

Usually look like:

```python
    def test():
       res = function(value)
       assert res == this_specific_thing
```
Note: typically we test a specific return value that we already know to be right.
This is problematic for several reasons. 
---
## Unit Tests In Reality

Worse, they probably look like this:

```python
    def test_1():
       res = function(value)
       assert res == this_specific_thing

    def test_2():
       res = function(other_value)
       assert res == this_one_edge_case

    def test_3():
       res = function(one_more_value)
       assert res == this_other_edge_case
```
Note: We often end up writing multiplpe tests for the same unit. 

And what if we miss an edge case? 

Why all the duplicate code?

So, how do we fix this?
---
### Property Tests!

* Look like a unit test
* Great at catching edge cases
* Reduces duplicate code
* Make you think about your code. A lot. 

Note: 

---
### Yes, but what ARE they?
* Property tests are designed to test the invariants in your code
    * test the things that should never change about your code
* These invariants represent the properties of the unit under test

Note: the value that gets returned can change depending on the input.

The properties of your test should never change. 
---
# Nope, you're still not making sense
(Me, the first 10 times I read about property tests)

Note: let's see if we can make it clear with an example
---
#### So, addition has certain properties that it must obey:
* Commutative
    * a + b = b + a
* Associative
    * a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
* Identity
    * a + 0 = a
* Distributive
    * a * (b + c) = ab + ac 

Note: the idea of property tests is that we test these criteria rather than testing all sorts of cases
---
#### In test form, that looks like
```python
@given(st.integers(), st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_addition(x, y, z):
    # test commutative
    assert x + y == y + x

    #test associative
    assert x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    # test identity
    assert x + 0 == x

    # test distributive
    assert x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z

```
Note: With these tests, we don't care what values we give it or what value it returns.

We only care that those values adhere to these properties,
---
## Hold up!
Other than that decorator, that looks a lot like a unit test!

What are you trying to pull here?

Note: The tests themselves are nothing special. They are essentially just unit tests, but we're testing the properties of the unit.

Except for that decorator

---
### That decorator is really the magic of Hypothesis
Basic Property Test Form
```python
from hypothesis import given
from hypothesis import strategies as st

@given(st.integers(), st.integers(), st.integers())
def test_addition(x, y, z):
    # test commutative
    assert x + y == y + x

    #test associative
    assert x + (y + z) == (x + y) + z

    # test identity
    assert x + 0 == x

    # test distributive
    assert x * (y + z) == x * y + x * z
```

Note: The big difference is that the test values are randomly generated and run multiple times, that's what the decorator does.

---
### The power of Hypothesis

Is in the volume and type of random data it creates

* @given is a decorator that generates the random data

* Strategies are the kinds of random data you can generate

Note: At it's heart, Hypothesis is a complex random data generator with some extra goodies thrown in.
---

## Strategies
* ints, strings, floats, booleans, datetime, uuids...
    * These can take various parameters like min_value, max_value, etc
* lists, tuples, dicts, set, streams, iterables...
* Roll your own
    * you can build your own strategies from existing strategies and functions that transform the data
---
### The incredible shrinking error
After finding a failure, hypothesis will then shrink the test case to find the simplest failing example.

This helps you pinpoint where edge cases might begin. 

So, if it fails with the int 142846292 it might then try the int 1
---
## Other cool stuff
* Hypothesis keeps a database of bugs and will retry those values next time you run it
* By default it runs your tests 200 times, but you can change that to any amount
    * The more tests you run, the more likely you are to find a failing edge case
---
### Fibonacci
```python
from hypothesis import given, settings
from hypothesis import strategies as st

def fibonacci(n):
    next = 1
    current = 0
    fib = 0
    sequence = []
    for ctr in range(0, n + 1):
        fib = next + current
        sequence.append(fib)
        next = current
        current = fib
    return sequence

```
Returns [1,1,2,3,5,8,13...]

Note: So, what are the properties of Fibonacci numbers?
---
### Fibonacci Test
```python
@given(st.integers(max_value=10))
@settings(max_examples=5)
def test_fibonacci(s):
    res = fibonacci(s)
    for i in range(len(res) - 2):
        assert res[i] + res[i + 1] == res[i + 2]
```

Note: The max_examples will do just as you'd expect. 

Also, the max_value was needed because otherwise, it was sending large numbers and locking up my laptop. 
---
## Ok, sounds great!
## How do I do this in the real world?

Let's look at an example

---
## Requirements

* Takes SQL Result Set
* Returns a dictionary
* Result Set can hold duplicate ids
* The key is the id from a result
* The value is a dict
    * Has keys 'name' and 'total'
    * 'name' never changes
    * 'total' accumulates the total values from each result in the set
---
## Function to test
```python
from hypothesis import given, settings
from hypothesis import strategies as st

def make_agg(items):
    res = {}
    for item in items:
        if res.get(item[0]):
            res[item[0]]['total'] = res[item[0]]['total'] + item[2]
        else:
            res[item[0]] = {'name': item[1], 'total': item[2]}
    return res

```
---
### Strategies
```python
@given(
        st.lists(
            st.tuples(
                st.integers(min_value = 1),
                st.text(),
                st.integers(min_value=1)
                ),
            max_size=10
            )
        )
```

Note: The strategy here is a little complicated because it's nested. 

There are ways to make this easier, see the docs for examples.

Each of the 200 runs will create a new list of tuples, each list will vary in size. Each tuple will have those three elements, but each with random data.
---
### Tests
```python
def test_make_agg(stuff):
    res = make_agg(stuff)
    assert type(res) is dict
    for thing in stuff:
        assert thing[0] in res
        assert res.get(thing[0]).get('name') == thing[1]

    for k,v in res.items():
        assert type(k) is int
        assert type(v['name']) is str
        assert type(v['total']) is int

```
Note: You can see that the strategies and the tests are a bit more complex than regular unit tests. 

If you run this test with pytest and everything passes, it looks just like any other passing test

---
## But, how do I figure out what properties to test?
Most often, they are the same as the business requirements

Note: This is the hardest question on property based testing. 

Some functions are easy and obvious, most are not. 

The business requirements are a great place to start.

---
 ### Again, here are the requirements
* Returns a dictionary
* Result Set can hold duplicate ids
* The key is the id from a result
* The value is a dict
    * Has keys 'name' and 'total'
    * 'name' never changes
    * 'total' accumulates the total values from each result in the set
---
### Here are the tests
```python
        st.lists(
            st.tuples(
                st.integers(min_value = 1),
                st.text(),
                st.integers(min_value=1)
                ),

    assert type(res) is dict
    for thing in stuff:
        assert thing[0] in res
        assert res.get(thing[0]).get('name') == thing[1]

    for k,v in res.items():
        assert type(k) is int
        assert type(v['name']) is str
        assert type(v['total']) is int
```
Note: What we are testing are the invariant properties. 

We aren't looking to make sure the total is correct, we'd use a unit test for that or we could make a complex test that does the calculation here is we wanted.


---
## But if we find a bug...
```

Falsifying example: test_make_agg(stuff=[(1, '0', 1), (1, '', 1)])
You can add @seed(55553420282915014518177008188105912532)
to this test or run pytest with --hypothesis-seed=
55553420282915014518177008188105912532 to reproduce this failure.

```
Note: I ran this 5 times over and over again, no problems. 

When I ran it once for 200 times and an error fell out. 

Notice that the failure is on some really small numbers. Hypothesis will shrink the failure until it finds the simplest failing case.

So, the original failure could have been with much larger numbers, but hypothesis shrunk it down to the smallest it could find that failed.

Also, this bug is actually in the way the test was set up. I didn't do anything to match names with account ids, so we're testing for a name that doesn't match the first name that got saved into the dict. 
---
## Reproducing bugs

* For local dev, Hypothesis uses a local examples database
    * Any known bug will automatically be tried every time you run the tests.
* You can provide explicit examples
    * @example(stuff= [(...)])
* A failing test gets hashed and can be used as a seed
    * You can add the @seed decorator
    * You can run with --hypothesis-seed= if using pytests
---
## So, I should swap all my unit tests for property tests?

No! 

Property tests are complicated and not always obvious. 

They are best applied around business critical units.
